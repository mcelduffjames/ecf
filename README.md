## Week of May 29 - June 2, 2017
1. Monday: Memorial Day, no work.
2. Tuesday: Waiting to be granted permissions to databases and have Qlikview installed so I can begin my first small project of a Qlikview to Qliksense migration. Practicing with Markdown and the capabilities (and limits) of the file type. Worked on the Equity Example (data from Qliksense online forums), sharpened up visuals and attempted to further understand expressions. Attended a Qliksense NPrinting meeting to talk about Qlik licenses and problems. Became involved with NPrinting Testing.
3. Wednesday: The battle for permissions wages on. Qlik NPrinting meeting to set up Qliksense to email out to people (my understanding). Needed to obtain permission to install Qlik NPrinting, obtain permission to access the report files, obtain access to the NPrinting amin privileges. NPrinting meeting to set up Qliksense subscription reports - found out I don't have enough permissions to do anything. Worked to compile docmentation for NPrinting subscription reports obtained from Doug. Important items for each report include dashboard name, NSQ file, recipients, report name, filters (name, field name, field value), and schedule. Create a table in Excel as a preliminary answer to the documentation. Will be eventually converted and added to documentation for all server actions.
4. Thursday: QlikView has been installed. Reading "Simply SQL" to better learn SQL. Tasked to migrate the Rate Plan Surveillance Dashboad from QlikView to QlikSense. Copied script from QlikView to Qliksense.
